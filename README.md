MyMusicQoE
=======

The focus of this MyMusicQoE is to gather information about the quality of expirience of a music streaming service.

In order to acomplish this, we are using the FOSS streaming platform Airsonic.
We will be focusing in the transcoding side of airsonic to gather data about codecs and it's setting with the best quality/size ratio.


This project is running under academic purposes as a final project for the computer science course of the Polytecnhic Institute of Leiria.
